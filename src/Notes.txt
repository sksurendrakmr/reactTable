Having to build some sort of a table to visualize the data
is inevitable.

Building our own table component can be challengin and
time consuming.

React table is a collection of hooks for Building
powerful tables and data grid experiences.
These hooks are lightweight, composable, and ultra-extensible.

But the do not render any markup or styles for you i.e.
react table doesn't render or supply any actual UI elements.

So its a table utility and not a table component.
